<p>Hi learner!</p>

<p>Nice to see that you covered a long journey and reached till here. This is the final project of the bootcamp that&#39;ll help you strengthen your concepts on Model Deployment.</p>

<p>It consists of 2 parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Datathon</li>
	<li>Deployed web application</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h3>Datathon</h3>

<p>Participate in this datathon and submit your predictions in a CSV file&nbsp;by using any model of your choice:&nbsp;<a href="https://dphi.tech/practice/challenge/54" target="_blank">https://dphi.tech/practice/challenge/54</a></p>

<hr />
<h3>Deployed Web Application</h3>

<p>After you&rsquo;re done building the model, you can start creating a Web Application for the purpose of filtering loan applications.</p>

<p>The features that you have used for building the ML model will be the form inputs that will be taken from the bank official. You need to display &ldquo;Approved&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rejected&rdquo; on the basis of whether the application was approved or not.</p>

<p>Finally, deploy the application on Heroku and share the link with us in the form below!</p>
