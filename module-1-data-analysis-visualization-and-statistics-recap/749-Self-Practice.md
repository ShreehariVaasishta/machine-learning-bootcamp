Now let's practice what we've learned on a real dataset!

The dataset can be directly accessed with the link (Yes, read_csv accepts links, too!):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/UNdata_Greenhouse_Gas.csv

Tasks:

* Load the CSV file into a variable - greenhouse_data
* Use the description function to understand how the data looks like
* Print its first 10 rows using head()
* Print its last 10 rows using tail()
* Check if there are any null values
* Store the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'file2.csv'
